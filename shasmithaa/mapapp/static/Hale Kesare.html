                Hale Kesare is a small village located in the Mysore District of Karnataka, India.
                It's situated immediately north of the Ring Road and near the R.S. Naidu Nagar satellite bus station, making it a well-connected area to the main city.
                The village is part of the developing residential landscape in Mysore, though it has also been associated with the location of a Solid Waste Treatment and Recycling Plant which has been a point of concern for residents regarding pollution.
